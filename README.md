### ✅ Tips for Final Touches:

- **Video Hosting:** Upload the demo video on YouTube or GitHub (or use GitHub Releases for `.mp4`) and update the `[![Watch the Demo]()` link.
- **Banner and Thumbnail:** Create a clean banner (e.g., using Canva or Figma) and host it on GitHub, Imgur, or your own CDN.
- **Add Badges:** Consider adding badges (build status, license, etc.) using [shields.io](https://shields.io/).
